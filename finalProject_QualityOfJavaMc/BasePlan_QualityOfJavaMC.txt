My WDD131 Project: Minecraft Java Edition Modding Website

Site Title: Quality of JavaMC

The subject I want to make the website about is Minecraft Java Edition Modding.

I'll a home page explaining the purpose of the site, which is to provide users with Minecraft mods and modpacks that provide quality-of-life improvements. 
I'll have a second page where people can commission their own mods to be made.
I'll have a third page to help users find popular quality-of-life mods and modpacks with links to download mods.

General Page Formatting:
- Each webpage will have a mobile view and a wider screen view
- On mobile, the different page options will be put in a hamburger menu (might have a different symbol)
- On wider screens, the page options will be listed below the page title
- Each page will have the same header and footer
- Top left of Header will include a svg logo/icon
- Footer will include the last time the site was updated

Specific Page Formatting:
- [Home] page will have a hero image for mobile, and a different hero image for wider screen view
- [Commission Mods] page will have (fake) contact info for people to commission mods to be made
- [Find Mods] page will have a selection of popular quality-of-life Minecraft mods and modpacks that the user can click and be directed to their mod page

 

The reason that I chose this subject is because for a long time I have has a passion for compiling Minecraft Java Edition modpacks and more recently, even creating Minecraft Java Edition mods! This project is about a subject I am passionate about, and think would be fun to make!
